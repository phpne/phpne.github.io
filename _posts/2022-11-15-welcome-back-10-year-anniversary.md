We are delighted to announce the long-anticipated return of PHP North East. After nearly three years away, we're returning with a social event to catch up with fellow PHP developers and celebrate PHP North East's [10-year anniversary](https://twitter.com/phpne/status/1361772774725988357). It'd be great if you could join us!

The event will take place in the conservatory at Liberty House, 48 Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 1TT [(map)](https://goo.gl/maps/4inS7GQ75DrPcRAa7).

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering. Feedback, suggestions, and ideas for future topics are welcome on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phpne).

If you can't make this event, don't fret - PHP North East will be running regularly again in the New Year!
