We are pleased to announce our May event for PHP North East is “An Introduction to HAProxy” by Lee Blackwell.

Lee is going to be talking to us about HAProxy, a swiss army knife of HTTP and will explain why he believes it deserves a place in front of almost any web server. He will cover getting HAProxy up and running, why a PHP dev might be interested in HAProxy, SSL offloading, session stickiness (and detecting that in your PHP code), multiple backends and how he made sure avid.com "never ever" goes down.

After more than 20 years working in 'corporate America' (3Com, Worldcom, Citi, Avid), Lee took up the position as Head of IT & Security for Visualsoft. His core strengths are infrastructure & data centre, Linux, cloud (the big three - AWS/GCP/Azure), operations and audit. He has been taking his prior development experience (Java, Perl, Pascal, Bash and a smidge of C) and applying it to PHP!

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, Visualsoft, iamproperty, Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
