We are pleased to announce the November event for PHP North East, Using Beanstalkd to spread the work of your PHP application by [Andrew Taylor][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Using Beanstalkd to spread the work of your PHP application** by [Andrew Taylor][1].

Beanstalkd is a lightweight and easy to use job queue. In this overview we will look at the features of Beanstalkd and how we can use it to run time-consuming tasks asynchronously. We will also briefly look at the PHP client library for Beanstalkd, Pheanstalk. We'll finally tie it altogether in some use cases with Supervisord, the process management daemon.

After this talk you should understand the benefits of off-loading your tasks using a basic queue and have a robust method of implementation that you're comfortable using in your next project.
