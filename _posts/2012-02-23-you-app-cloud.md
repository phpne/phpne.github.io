Your app is gaining traction but you've hit a problem, you need to scale - we'll look at various different ways you can get more performance from your application from scaling inside your current infrastructure with technologies such as memcache to completely separating your application out into segments to take advantage of the big clouds, like Azure and Amazon and everything in-between. Also looking into just how reliable the cloud is.
