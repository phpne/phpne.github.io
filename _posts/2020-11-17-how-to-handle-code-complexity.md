We are pleased to announce the November 2020 event for PHP North East, "How to Handle Code Complexity" by Rob Waller. This is an online event streaming here: https://youtu.be/7qB83HW1AhM

Complexity is an emergent property of code, at some point, a codebase will cross a tipping point between simple and complicated. This has a number of negative consequences related to bugs, testability, extendability, and ultimately project success. This talk will explain what code complexity is, how it emerges, how to spot it early, and how to mitigate its effects.

Rob is a developer with a passion for quality and security. He has 15 years experience as a coder, manager and architect.

Thank you to our sponsors: Ronald James Recruitment and iamproperty who make our events possible.
