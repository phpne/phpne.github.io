We are pleased to announce the January 2020 event for PHP North East, "How to Implement a powerful GraphQL API into your Laravel application" by Paul King.

Graph QL is an alternative approach to traditional API's, originally developed by Facebook. I will show you how this query language can be implemented for your API, so that your clients can request as little or as much data as they need.

Paul King runs Flow Software Solutions along with his brother David (you might know them as the King brothers) - they develop apps for the mobile workforce.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Ronald James Group, iamproperty, Opia, and TusPark Eagle Labs.

After the event, we usually go to The Town Wall for a drink.
