S3 Uploads with Cognito by Michael Peacock
Amazon S3 is popular, scalable and low cost storage service, used by many web applications. Uploading files to S3 from your web application could either involve the image going to your server, and your server uploading it, or your users uploading directly. Cognito takes much of the hassle out of direct uploads. You can restrict write access for your users to specific sections of an S3 bucket, and easily support guest users. Cognito works by generating temporary credentials for your user, and using those to grant them permission to upload to S3. Michael is a consultant CTO and software engineer, providing high level technical consultancy, leadership and development services to a range of businesses.
