We are pleased to announce the March 2023 event for PHP North East, “A Practical Guide to Event Sourcing” by Daniel Gadd.

Event sourcing is an event driven architecture, where all changes to an application’s state are recorded as a sequence of events. This approach enables applications to maintain and manage data in a highly consistent and auditable way, and allows complex features to be built in a novel way. In this talk we’ll take a high level look at what event sourcing is, review some practical examples, and discuss what some of the more prominent advantages and disadvantages are.

Daniel is the technical director at Land Digital, and one of his main focuses over the last few years has been looking at how he can positively impact their DX to empower our developers to work efficiently and effectively.

Thank you to our sponsor: [Sharpe Recruitment](https://www.sharperecruitment.co.uk/) who makes our events possible.
