We are pleased to announce the September event for PHP North East, "Sync or Swim" by Gary Hockin.

Tools exist that lets us modify state in one place and make sure that change is proliferated automatically to all other places. Using websockets and webhooks, we can modify and react to state changes without worrying too much about the code needed to keep applications in sync.

Weâ€™ll talk about best practices for architecting an application to handle state in one place, and what tools exist (including Twilio Sync) to help you do this automatically. Join us as we take a very broken JavaScript game, and architect our application to make it reactive, secure and playable.

Gary Hockin travels all over the world empowering developers as a Developer Evangelist for Twilio (fine purveyors of communication APIs). He is a talented and evocative speaker, a cultivated author of impressively entertaining blog posts, and records elegant and informative screencasts and videos. Gary's also a contributor to the Zend Framework and is argumentative enough to be on the community review team.

When Gary had a real job, he was a developer of at least "competent" standard with over 20 years experience. When not developing, speaking about developing, reading about developing or writing about developing, Gary enjoys playing computer games and arguing with his wife and two kids. Gary has recently discovered that events ask speakers to write their own biography text, and you can get away with writing pretty much anything you want.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, iamproperty and Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
