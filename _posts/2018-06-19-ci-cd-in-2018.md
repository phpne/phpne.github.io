For our June meeting we are pleased to announce CI/CD in 2018 by Harry Lawrence.

Harry will be talking about some of the various ways you can construct a pipeline from commit to production demonstrating some of the new tools helping out with Continuous Integration in 2018. Harry is a software developer for Moltin. He spends most of his time these days writing Go, although on occasion PHP, among other things.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza, Campus North who provide the venue and drinks, Opia who help us out.

The event will take place in the classroom at Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF.

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on Twitter.

After the event, many of us will be going to The Ware Rooms next door, for some liquid refreshments, don't forget your discount cards (we should have some on the day if you didn't get one last month).
