For our September meeting, we are pleased to announce On the Horizon by Nathan Dunn and ORM Overview by Jack Wagstaffe.

First up, Nathan will be talking to us about queues in Laravel and how to track jobs using Horizon, a Laravel-powered dashboard for monitoring queued jobs. Nathan is a freelance software developer at Solosoft, where he helps companies build their Software-as-a-Service products.

Next, Jack will be taking us through ORMs and will be comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the Active Record and Data Mapper patterns. Jack is a Web Application Developer at Prospect Path. He is primarily a PHP developer but is also familiar with front-end technologies.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza, Campus North who provide the venue and drinks, Opia who help us out.

The event will take place in the classroom at Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (map).

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on Twitter.

After the event, many of us will be going to The Ware Rooms next door, for some liquid refreshments, don't forget your discount cards (we should have some on the day if you didn't get one last month).
