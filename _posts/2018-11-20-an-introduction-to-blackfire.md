We are pleased to announce our November event for PHP North East - An Introduction to Blackfire presented by James Mowatt. During this talk, James will be discussing Blackfire profiling and the benefit it will bring to your application development workflow. James is a Lead Developer at Visualsoft, an e-commerce provider based in Stockton with offices in Newcastle, Manchester and London.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza and beer, Visualsoft who help with the venue, and Opia who help us out.

After the event, we usually go around the corner to the Ware Rooms for a drink.
