We are pleased to announce our June event for PHP North East is “Securing PHP apps using OpenID Connect” by Steve Hobbs.

Let's quickly dive into the world of authentication and authorization, as we go through OAuth, OIDC, and JSON Web Tokens, and look at a demo where Steve shows you how to secure a PHP application using OIDC. Steve is a developer experience engineer at Auth0, working on SDKs and documentation. His aim is to help developers get up and running with Auth0 as quickly and easily as possible.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, Visualsoft, iamproperty, Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
