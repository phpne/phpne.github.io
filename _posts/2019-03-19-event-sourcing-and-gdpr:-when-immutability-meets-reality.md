We are pleased to announce our March event for PHP North East is “Event Sourcing and GDPR: When Immutability Meets Reality” by Stuart Herbert.

The last couple of years has seen a surge of interest in Event Sourcing in the PHP community. This has coincided with the introduction of GDPR, the new data privacy regulations rolled out across all EU28 nations.

In this talk, Stuart will introduce you to the core principles of GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. He’ll look at what capabilities you need to add to your application/service to allow your business to comply with this landmark legislation. And then he’ll look at how these requirements do—or don’t—map into the Event Sourcing world.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, Visualsoft, iamproperty, Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
