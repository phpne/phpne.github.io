We are pleased to announce for our July event for PHP North East, we will be talking about all things related to collections in Laravel!

Nathan will be giving us an introduction to Laravel collections covering basic to more advanced methods. Nathan is the Innovation Director at packagedby, a newly formed software development agency based in Gateshead.

After Nathan has given his talk, Jack will giving us a demo of how legacy code can be refactored to collections and how some of the more recent and advanced additions to collections in Laravel can be used to produce concise readable code. Jack is a web developer working for Prospect Path and co-organiser of PHP North East.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, Visualsoft, iamproperty, packagedby and Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
