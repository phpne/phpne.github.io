We are pleased to announce the March 2020 event for PHP North East, "Introduction to OpenAPI" by Lorna Mitchell.

OpenAPI Specification is a machine and human readable way to describe APIs. From these specs we can generate documentation, libraries, tests, and generally give users the tools they need to know exactly what to expect from our APIs. This talk shows you around OAS from the beginning, demonstrating how to create the specs and recommending some tools to help the process. Once you have the spec, things get much more interesting and this talk will showcase some of the things we can do with an API described this way. Recommended for anyone who cares about APIs and likes shiny new technology.

Lorna is based in Yorkshire, UK; she is a Developer Advocate with Nexmo as well as a published author and experienced conference speaker. She brings her technical expertise on a range of topics to audiences all over the world with her writing and speaking engagements, always delivered with a very practical slant. In her spare time, Lorna blogs at http://lornajane.net.

You can tune in to the event here: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/phpne-march-2020 . We will be kicking things off at 6:20pm.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Ronald James Group, iamproperty, Opia, and TusPark Eagle Labs.
