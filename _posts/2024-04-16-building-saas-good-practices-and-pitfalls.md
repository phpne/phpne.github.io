We are pleased to announce the April 2024 event for PHP North East, “Building SaaS: Good practices and pitfalls” by Peter Houghton.

It’s natural to prioritise feature delivery and concentrate on your product’s unique selling proposition (USP), but aspects of your application like data management, security, and scaling can often be overlooked.

In this talk, Peter will share practical advice and highlight real-world pitfalls encountered while building the Wordnerds Platform over the past five years.

Peter is the Head of Engineering at Wordnerds, a venture capital-backed tech startup based in Gateshead.
