We are pleased to announce the July 2020 event for PHP North East, "Introducing the serverless LAMP stack" by Ben Smith. This is an online event streaming here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJPBC9v_-U

AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, MySQL, PHP - it’s LAMP but not as you know it. In this session, I’ll show why there has never been a better time to build serverless applications with PHP.

Using this new LAMP stack to build serverless applications allows PHP developers to benefit from the agility and scalability enabled by the serverless paradigm, all without needing to manage servers. I’ll demo how to get started running your PHP code using functions as a service. You’ll learn how to connect to databases at scale with spiky workloads, and continue to use your favourite libraries and tools, without impacting performance or availability.

Learn how to become a serverless PHP developer, and use the world’s most popular web runtime to build scalable, agile apps without the server management.

Ben Smith is a Senior developer advocate at AWS with a passion for serverless, automation and web development. With his AWS blog series on “The serverless LAMP stack”, Ben is especially interested in making serverless technologies more accessible for PHP developers.
