For our July meeting we are pleased to announce Unit Testing Legacy Code by Richard Harrison.

Are you working with a legacy code base? Are you keen to add unit tests, but struggling to get started? This talk will present four refactoring techniques to help get legacy code "under test". Richard has developed PHP for over 15 years. In that time, he's worked in big companies and small, contract and permanent, and both green field and legacy projects. He currently works as a Senior Developer for PODFather, in Edinburgh.

We also have Ade-Lee Adebiyi telling us about his project: make it pop - a card game designed to prepare you for the best and worst clients possible.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza, Campus North who provide the venue and drinks, Opia who help us out.

The event will take place in the classroom at Campus North, Carliol Square, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6UF (map).

The event is free and open to all, but please sign up online so that we have an idea of numbers for the venue and catering. Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on Twitter.

After the event, many of us will be going to The Ware Rooms next door, for some liquid refreshments, don't forget your discount cards (we should have some on the day if you didn't get one last month).
