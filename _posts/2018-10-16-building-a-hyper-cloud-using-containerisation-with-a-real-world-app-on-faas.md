We are pleased to announce our October event for PHP North East - Building a hyper-cloud utilising containerisation with a real-world application on FaaS presented by Indy Bains, Doug Thomson and Andrew Seymour.

Deployment: A demo and discussion on how containerisation can be utilised to create a single hyper cloud platform; capable of running modern microservices, legacy windows applications as well as future proofed functions-as-a-service. The demo will cover how the entire platform can be built utilising infrastructure-as-code, and how it incorporates a single toolset to manage both legacy and modern applications

FaaS: A look through the history of application development with a glimpse into the future of FaaS (function-as-a-service) and how to build real world rest applications (with PHP) utilising Faas as the building blocks. Delving into the deployment and use of OpenFaaS to prevent vendor lock-in with a demo of what that would look like.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza and beer, Visualsoft who help with the venue, and Opia who help us out.

After the event we usually go around the corner to the Ware Rooms for a drink.
