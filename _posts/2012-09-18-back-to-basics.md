We are pleased to announce the August event for PHP North East, **Back To Basics** by [Anthony Sterling][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Back To Basics** by [Anthony Sterling][1].

We're getting back to basics this month. We're holding an interactive session consisting, almost entirely, of live coding. We'll be taking a basic legacy PHP application (you know the type, we've all been there) , discussing how to improve it, the benefits which that improvement brings, and then implementing said improvement.

[Anthony Sterling][1]: Anthony is the Technical Director for Drummond Central. He likes reading about application design and architecture, and enjoys short walks on the beach with chips; okay, just chips.
