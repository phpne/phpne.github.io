We are pleased to announce the October event for PHP North East, Using Composer to manage dependencies and distribute your code in style by [Matt Kirwan][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Using Composer to manage dependencies and distribute your code in style** by [Matt Kirwan][1].

Composer - a “dependency manager for PHP” is currently gaining a lot of traction within the PHP community. This introductory level talk will first take a look at what problems a tool like composer solves and how it is unique, a little bit of history and then it will then run through the ridiculously simple installation process, basic usage and finally demonstrate a real(ish) solution for managing your code efficiently.

Matt Kirwan is a developer with an unhealthy obsession for learning. Currently working and living in Teesside, Matt, like many other developers is beginning to realise the power of truly re-usable component or library based code - the discovery of composer was just one catalyst for this thinking. You can check out Matt’s website where he usually waffles about tech related topics and uploads the occasional picture. [http://www.mattkirwan.com/][1]
