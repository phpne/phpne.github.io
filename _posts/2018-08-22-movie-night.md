For our August meeting we are pleased to announce we're having a movie night!

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment and Opia.

The event will take place at Quilliam Brothers, Claremont Buildings, 1 Eldon Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RD (map).

We will have a wide selection of drinks and snacks on the night, and a selection of three relevant movies for us to chose from.

As the venue is limited (25 attendees), there is a minimum charge of Â£1 for this event, though you can donate more than that if you like.

Feedback, suggestions and ideas for future topics are welcome on Twitter.
