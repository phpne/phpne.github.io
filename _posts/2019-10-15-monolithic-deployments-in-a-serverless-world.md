We are pleased to announce the October event for PHP North East, "Monolithic deployments in a serverless world" by Michael Peacock.

In a world where everyone is talking of serverless architectures and FaaS, many projects are still single codebases that deploy as a single unit; and for many use-cases this still works well.

In this talk, we will walk through some of the tools and services which make it easy to host and deploy our monolithic applications.

We will look at deploying applications to:

- Dokku
- Forge managed servers
- Elastic Beanstalk (and a walk through of the key AWS components for hosting a Laravel project)

And since it is a serverless world, we will take a quick look at how to deploy our monoliths to serverless with Laravel Vapour.

Michael is a consultant CTO and freelance software engineer, working predominantly with SaaS start-ups to help them manage their technical systems, build products and grow teams. An author and conference speaker, Michael also co-organises PHPNE.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment, iamproperty and Opia.

After the event, we usually go to a nearby bar for a drink.
