We are pleased to announce the July event for PHP North East, **Refactoring** by [Oli Wood][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Refactoring** by [@colclimate][1]

[Oli Wood][1]: Oli started his career in Java and Oracle development, but is now a PHP dude mostly working in CodeIgniter.  He started weddingtales.co.uk, and currently works for canddi.com.

Oli just spent the last 3 months working on on taking an existing piece of code, battering it into shape and getting it back out there.  We've all done it, we'll all have to do it, learn from the massive holes Oli fell into.
