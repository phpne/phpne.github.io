We are pleased to announce our January event for PHP North East - "How we transitioned frameworks with very different authentication models without any disruption to customers" presented by Anthony Totton.

When replatforming there are so many considerations, from performance to frameworks, but an often overlooked element is how this affects users interaction with the platform. A user's experience should always be a major consideration, and this talk will outline various strategies and techniques used to overcome the many challenges posed by a replatforming in regards to users.

Anthony has played many roles in his career so far, dealing with varied technologies. He likes to Keep things Simple, and strives for elegant solutions to problems.

Thanks to our sponsors whose financial support make our events possible: Sharpe Recruitment who provide the pizza and beer, Visualsoft who help with the venue, and Opia who help us out.

After the event, we usually go around the corner to the Ware Rooms for a drink.
