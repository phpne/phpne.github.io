Returning to our regular slot of the third Tuesday of the month, we are pleased to announce the March event for PHP North East, **Security** by [@ethicalhack3r][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Security** by [@ethicalhack3r][1]

The presentation will be an introduction to web application security and how you can secure your own applications using free/open source resources and tools. I will be covering OWASP, Secure Coding and application testing using black box and white box approaches.
