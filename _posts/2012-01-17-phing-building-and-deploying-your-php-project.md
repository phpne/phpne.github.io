We are pleased to announce the January event for PHP North East, **Phing Building and Deploying your PHP Project** by [@JamieFDHurst][1].

The event will take place at the Post Office in Pink Lane ([@PostOfficeNE1][2]) courtesy of PNE.

**Phing: Building & Deploying Your PHP Project** by [@JamieFDHurst][1]

You might've heard some talk going around about these so-called build tools.
 - What are they?
 - What do they do?
 - Are they any use?
 - How can I use them?
 - Will this be a long presentation or will we get to the pub a bit earlier?

All these are questions you could be asking. Phing is one of these build tools, and it can be used for so much more than just building your PHP project. Phing can automate testing, documentation generation, code coverage reports, code checking and much more. This talk will give you a brief insight into the power of Phing, how you can use it to build and deploy applications remotely when coupled with a version control system, and how you can use it as a starting point for a full continuous integration setup.

Be forewarned, this talk may contain some or none of the following: live coding, bash scripting, usage of a well-known version control system and XML.
